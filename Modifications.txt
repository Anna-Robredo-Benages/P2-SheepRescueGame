PRACTICE 2 - EXERCISE IN UNITY SCRIPTING 

To do the Sheep Rescue Game, first of all I did part 1 of the exercise until I had generated multiple sheep’s, that is, I completed all the steps 
explained in the slides of the practice that can be found in Aula Global. Once this was done, I took a look at part 2 in order to add some modifications 
and new functionalities to the game. So, the modifications and new functionalities of the game that I have added are:

	- A small heart model that flies up from any saved sheep to show their appreciation. Thus, there is a Prefab called Heart in my project.

	- Sound effects for three different situations:
		1.	When a sheep drops
		2.	When a sheep is hit
		3.	When a projectile is shot

	- Background music for the game 

	- Because the game had no failure state, no matter how many sheep drop to their demise, the player could keep going, I have introduced a way to 
	  keep the score of the game so that the game ends at some point. So, it works as follows: After three sheep have hit the invisible trigger behind 
	  the hay machine, the game will end.

	- A Title Scene with two different buttons, start and quit, and with the option of change the color of the hay machine by just clicking on it. 
	  There are three different colors, blue, red and yellow.

	- In order to view the track of the score and the mistakes done, I have manipulated the User Interface. So, the UI updates as sheep get saved and 
	  fall down. If you let three sheep drop down, a simple game over window pops up. If you press the Escape key, the Title scene loads.

	- Make the sheep’s spawn faster over time to increase the pressure, by making some modifications to SheepSpawner script. In the script, I have 
	  commented the lines of code that were written before I applied this new functionality.
